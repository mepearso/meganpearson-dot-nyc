		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Hi! I'm Megan. I'm a web developer and designer. For me, the aesthetic and usability of a product is as important as the functionality itself. When approaching a project, my process involves creating lots of sketches and detailed mockups before ever delving into the code. I love the challenge of discovering what to build and how it should be experienced. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Formerly, I was a flight instructor and then an industrial engineer, and, in 2012, I co-founded the Dapper Dog co. I enjoyed translating my ideas and designs into a functional website, discovering what made for a good user experience along the way.
			</p>
			<p>
			When I'm not coding, you can find me trying (but failing) to keep my air plants alive. Who knew they needed water? They are called <em>AIR</em> plants.<br/>
			<br/>
			If you have are interested in working with me or have a unique freelance project, please <a href="#contact"><em>drop me a line</em></a>.

					<p>Using the Panoramio and Google Places APIs, I created a  visual bucket list app for users to save locations they want to visit.

				<div class="details">
					<p>On this group project, we developed an app that pokes a bit of fun at New York City and her residents. Users can choose a neighborhood they want to hang out in and are then assigned a stereotyped, curated day plan based on their choice.
					</p>
					<p>Using the Instagram and Yelp APIs, we customized the day plan activities with photos and restaurant &amp; bar reviews.

				<div class="details">
					<p>I designed this wiki to allow users to search for relevant information about their birthdays. Specifically, a user can enter their birth month and day and discover their zodiac, the largest star in their zodiological constellation, and the planet associated with their birth month. 
					</p>
					<p>Users can create and edit articles, using Markdown, and will be automatically emailed, via the Mailgun API, when an article they've written has been edited.
					</p>
					<p>I created all of the graphics with a mixture of hand-drawing, Photoshop &amp; Illustrator.

					<p>In this classic children's game, I built a simple computer opponent to play a random move. More importantly, I incorporated a screaming goat to alert players when they've made an incorrect move (going when it's not their turn or moving to a space that's already been selected).
